/**
 * Per-service **authored** ingress (`services.<name>.x-turbopanel.hosting`).
 * Mirrors the instance's `turbopanel/src/lib/compose/hosting-extension.ts` —
 * same shape, same rules, same messages, so the editor says what the save would
 * say instead of blessing a document the control plane then rejects.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it is emphatically not
 *
 * `hosting` declares an **ingress route** — a hostname (optionally a path
 * prefix) that TurboPanel's edge answers on, terminated with TLS and forwarded
 * to the service. It is never a `--publish`. Compose's own `ports:` binds a
 * host port straight onto a container and stays exactly what it always was; a
 * `hosting` entry opens no host port at all, and the two are not
 * interchangeable in either direction:
 *
 * - `ports:` is the answer for "this container must own host port 5432".
 * - `hosting` is the answer for "https://app.example.com should reach this
 *   service" — the edge owns 80/443 and routes by name.
 *
 * A raw TCP/UDP publish through the edge is a third thing again
 * (`hosting.options.protocol` on the row, `tcp` / `udp`), authored from the
 * panel rather than from compose. {@link HOSTING_KEY_REDIRECTS} says all of
 * this out loud for every key an author plausibly reaches for.
 *
 * ## Shape only
 *
 * Like every other parser in this directory, this module is pure and
 * database-free. It answers "is this a well-formed ingress declaration"; it
 * does **not** answer "does `certificateRef` name a certificate this
 * organization owns". That resolution splits the same way
 * `x-turbopanel.source.sourceId` does: the linter checks it when a surface
 * hands it the set (`knownTlsIds` / `knownIpIds` in `./lint`), and the
 * instance's deploy-prepare is the backstop that refuses rather than silently
 * nulling (`hosting_tls_ref_unresolved` / `hosting_ip_ref_unresolved`).
